Nested loops: loops inside loops.
There are three types of solutions for any problem. 1)brute force 2)better 3)optimal
for brute force, most of the solutions can be written using two  loops(loop inside loop).

1)find out how many rows you need to print.
2) how many columns you need to print.
3)what to print and what not to print.
